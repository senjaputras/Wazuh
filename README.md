This is my Wazuh explorer.

Sometimes documentation or tutorial in internet skip important small step.

First of all.
In this documentation I use Centralized Configuration. Where agent can be configured remotely by using the agent.conf.

There are 2 way to configure wazuh-agent:
1. Local Configuration (ossec.conf)
2. Centralized Configuration (agent.conf)
